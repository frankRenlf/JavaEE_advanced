<p>I'll just put four websites on it. My server may not be able to move any more;

    Also, some well done websites can't be released, because their databases are a bit vulnerable to attacks. I play on the intranet when I play, so it's OK, but I don't think it can be released this time;

    The Internet is very messy. One afternoon, I was attacked tens of thousands of times. I was afraid that my server would be crashed

    Some security measures have been taken for these websites, but this server has low resistance to ddos attacks</p>
